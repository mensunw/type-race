# TypeRace Game - Implementation Summary

## New Files Created

### Pages
- `app/page.tsx` - Landing page with Single Player and Multiplayer buttons
- `app/single/page.tsx` - Complete single player racing game with bot opponent
- `app/multiplayer/page.tsx` - Placeholder page for future multiplayer implementation

### Game Components
- `app/components/Track.tsx` - Visual racing track with player and bot cars
- `app/components/Stats.tsx` - Real-time WPM, accuracy, and time display
- `app/components/TypingArea.tsx` - Text display and input handling with character-by-character feedback
- `app/components/EndGameModal.tsx` - Game completion modal with results and restart options

## Key Features Implemented

### Single Player Game
- Complete typing race game with bot opponent (45 WPM default speed)
- Real-time progress tracking on visual racing track
- Character-by-character typing feedback (correct/incorrect highlighting)
- Live stats: WPM calculation, accuracy percentage, elapsed time
- Start/restart/reset game controls
- Win/lose conditions with end game modal

### Game Mechanics
- **Progress Calculation**: Based on correct characters typed vs total text length
- **WPM Calculation**: Gross WPM using (correct characters ÷ 5) ÷ elapsed minutes
- **Accuracy Calculation**: Correct characters ÷ total typed characters × 100
- **Bot Opponent**: Configurable speed, advances at consistent rate
- **Visual Track**: Horizontal racing track with car positions mapped to progress

### UI/UX Features
- Responsive design using TailwindCSS
- Clean, modern interface with gradient backgrounds
- Real-time visual feedback for typing
- Smooth animations for car movement
- End game modal with detailed statistics
- Easy navigation between game modes

### Configuration Options
- Bot speed easily configurable via `BOT_WPM` constant
- Sample text replaceable via `SAMPLE_TEXT` constant
- Component-based architecture for easy modification

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- React hooks for local state management
- Real-time timer updates using setInterval
- Game state machine: 'waiting' ’ 'active' ’ 'finished'

### Performance Optimizations
- useCallback hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient character-by-character comparison
- Cleanup of timers on component unmount

### Code Organization
- Modular component architecture
- TypeScript for type safety
- Clear separation of concerns between components
- Reusable components for future multiplayer implementation

## Future Roadmap (TODOs)
- Real-time multiplayer functionality via WebSockets
- Custom text import/selection
- Multiple difficulty levels
- User profiles and statistics tracking
- Global leaderboards
- Achievement system
