## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Word-Based System**: Chose word-based over character-based to support natural typing patterns
2. **Component Separation**: Clear separation of concerns between display, input, and game logic
3. **State Management**: React hooks over external state managers for simplicity
4. **Auto-Scrolling**: `scrollIntoView` implementation for smooth, reliable scrolling
5. **Configuration**: Modal-based settings for better UX than inline controls

### Performance Considerations
- Character rendering optimized with proper React keys
- Efficient useEffect dependencies to minimize re-renders
- Strategic use of useCallback for event handlers
- Minimal DOM manipulation through React state management
- Hidden input field approach for clean keystroke capture

### Future-Proofing
- Modular component architecture ready for multiplayer expansion
- Configurable race system extensible to new game modes
- Clean API surface for potential backend integration
- Responsive design foundation for mobile app development
