for the text box area:
- When the user types extra letters for a word, the extra letters should be added onto the word, and only advance once the user presses "spacebar" (i.e for "Lazy" if they type "Lazyyy", the text area should show "Lazyyy" and not go to the next word until the user presses spacebar)
